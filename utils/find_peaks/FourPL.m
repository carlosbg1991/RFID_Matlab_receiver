% miny = minimum asymptote. In an ELISA assay where you have a standard
% curve, this can be thought of as the response value at 0 standard
% concentration. slope = Hill slope. The Hill Slope or slope factor refers
% to the steepness of the curve. It could either be positive or negative.
% As the absolute value of the Hill slope increases, so does the steepness
% of the curve. ip = inflection point: The inflection point is defined as the
% point on the curve where the curvature changes direction or signs. This
% can be better explained if you can imagine the concavity of a sigmoidal
% curve. The inflection point is where the curve changes from being concave
% upwards to concave downwards. maxy = maximum asymptote. In an ELISA assay
% where you have a standard curve, this can be thought of as the response
% value for infinite standard concentration.

% Example:
% x=0:20;
% miny=0;slope=5;ip=10;d=0;maxy=10;
% y=FourPL(x,miny,slope,ip,maxy);plot(x,y)
%
y = maxy+(miny-maxy)./(1+(x./ip).^slope);
